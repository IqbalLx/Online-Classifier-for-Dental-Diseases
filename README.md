This file is not very well documented, we only stop in prototype due to limited training data. The main concept is the AI model to classify dental disease is uploaded on the cloud, in this prototype PC is act as a server. Then Raspberry Pi client controlled by client mobile phone to take picture (people can watch the Raspberry Pi cam display from their mobile phone). After capturing the image, the image sent to the cloud and return the result of disease class in their mobile phone display. If the disease is accute, the app aotomatically connect that people to the dentist.

The main problem we trying to solve by made this project is:
- Peoples are not aware with their dental health, so when they can check their dental health everyday with less than 5 minutes, we hope it's going to increased people awareness about their mouth condition
- Dentist service is too expensive. If there are more people who already aware about their mouth health, it'll increase the demand of dentist, so we hope the service fee is can be cheaper, so dental service is open for everyone
